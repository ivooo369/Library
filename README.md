# Library

This is a basic library app that I created while following The Odin Project's curriculum.

## Features:

- Creating a book by giving it a unique title, author, number of pages and marking it as read or unread;
- Removing a book from the library;
- Library log that tracks the total number of books and pages, as well as the number of read and unread books in the library;
- Local storage for all created books;

  I am considering adding authentication with a Google account in the future.

## Used technologies:

- HTML;
- CSS;
- JavaScript;
